CBM-II-KERNAL
=============

This assembler source is capable to assemble one of the
following CBM-II KERNALs:

- kernal.901244-03b.bin
- kernal.901244-04a.bin
- kernal.901244-04a.official.bin
- kernal.901244-04b.official.bin

This work is heavily based on Ulrich von Bassewitz's disassembly
of kernal.901244-03b.bin as found on his website
